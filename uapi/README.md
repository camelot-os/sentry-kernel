sentry-uapi is the user API library that delivers a full access to the [Outpost-OS](https://github.com/outpost-os) Sentry kernel interface.

This crate implement the low level interface to the Sentry kernel syscalls and associated system types:

* **Data types** — Sentry-uapi provides a complete set of data types and
  values that are required in order to properly exchange information with the Sentry kernel.
* **Sentry syscalls** — All syscall are defined, so that the kernel can be triggered easily.
  Syscall usage can be found in this very crate documentation.

This crate also support C bindings in order to allow the integration of C codebase into the
Outpost-OS operating system.

More information about the overall Sentry kernel and Outpost-OS concepts are defined in
the [Sentry kernel general documentation](https://outpost-sentry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
