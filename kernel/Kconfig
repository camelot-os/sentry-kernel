	  a dedicated, autotest-enabled specific syscall used by the autotest app,
	  that can be triggered through a serial communication with a CI or a test PC
	  to generate Sentry test reports.

    bool "Support for SMP architecture (EXPERIMENTAL)"

    help
      In SMP mode, the kernel can be spawned in parallel in multiple cores at the
      same time. As a consequence:
      - the initialization is differenciated between core 0 and other cores, core 0
        being responsible for the initialisation of system-wide data (e.g. task listing)
      - depending on the selected scheduling policy, task (or jobs) are assigned to cores.
        All task being single threaded, there is no parallelism constraint at task level,
        their core-assignation being dependent of the selected scheduler
      - all kernel code after bootup must be reentrant, using hardware SMP-related locks
        if needed for system-wide impacting codes (e.g. using spin locking)

    help
      Define the number of cores in the SMP architecture.
      Such an information is required in order to dimension some data (e.g. scheduling backend
      when using per-core scheduling FIFO) and also permits to automatically hang any core being
      out of the cores range (e.g. if this config is set to 2, but 3 cores are started at bootup,
      the kernel init sequence will automatically hold forever on third core)
