This is the Sentry kernel internal implementation documentation.

The Sentry kernel is a high security level micro-kernel implementation
made for high security embedded systems that include micro-controllers
in association with dedicated Secure Element component for security
crytpographical functions.

This document describes the overall kernel internals, strutures, functions,
and hierarchy of the Sentry sources. It targets kernel developers in order to
have a good understanding of the effective internal implementation of the
Sentry kernel.

This documentation is based on the Doxygen comments of the Sentry code, in order
to sync the documentation content with the effective source content.
